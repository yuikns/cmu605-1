2543949	Agent	Aed mac Echach Tirmcharna (died 575) was a King of Connacht from the Ui Briuin branch of the Connachta. He was the son of Echu Tirmcharna mac Fergusso (died ca. 556). He came to the throne in the year 557 and ruled till 575.The slaying of one of his sons was the cause of a war with the high-king Diarmait mac Cerbaill (died 563). Geoffrey Keating states that Diarmait held a feast at Tara at which Aed's son Curnan mac Aedo (died 559) slew a nobleman. Curnan then put himself under the protection of Forguss and Domnall mac Muichertaig of the Cenel nEogain of the northern Ui Neill who placed him under the protection of their kinsman Saint Columba. However Diarmait had Curnan executed for violating laws of Tara in 559. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, Curnan was torn from the hands of Columba. As a result Columba organized a confederacy of the northern Ui Neill including the Cenel Conaill with Aed of Connacht against Diarmait.In 560 the Battle of Cul Dreimne (in County Sligo) was fought by this alliance against Diarmait. The Annals of the Four Masters mention that the prayers of Columba prevailed over the druids of Diarmait and he was defeated. T.M. Charles-Edwards places this battle in later Cenel Caipre Droma Cliab territory in the region between the Northern Ui Neill and the Connachta stating that Diarmait was on the offensive and tried to cut the allies off. He also states that the true cause of this battle was probably a dispute over the succession to Diarmait.Byrne doubts the legitimacy of the early Ui Briun genealogies and even goes so far as to doubt that these early Ui Briun kings were even of this branch. He cites the reference in the annals to the death of Aed in 575 who is said to be killed by the Ui Briun and to a reference in the Annals of Innisfallen that he gave Enach Duin (Annaghdown on L.Corrib) to Saint Brendan of Clonfert. He doubts that a ruler from the Mag nAi region would be able to make this gift. Charles-Edwards on the other hand believes that the Ui Briun were set up in Connacht by Diarmait mac Cerbaill as a balance to the Ui Fiachrach before Aed joined the alliance against him.He was succeeded by his son Uatu mac Aedo(died 600).
